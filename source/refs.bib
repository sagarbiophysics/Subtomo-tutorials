   abstract = {Biological specimens suffer radiation damage when imaged in an electron microscope, ultimately limiting the attainable resolution. At a given resolution, an optimal exposure can be defined that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio in the image. Using a 2.6 Å resolution single particle cryo-EM reconstruction of rotavirus VP6, determined from movies recorded with a total exposure of 100 electrons/Å2, we obtained accurate measurements of optimal exposure values over a wide range of resolutions. At low and intermediate resolutions our measured values are considerably higher than obtained previously for crystalline specimens, indicating that both images and movies should be collected with higher exposures than are generally used. We demonstrate a method of using our optimal exposure values to filter movie frames, yielding images with improved contrast that lead to higher resolution reconstructions. This “high-exposure” technique should benefit cryo-EM work on all types of samples, especially those of relatively low molecular mass.},

   abstract = {Automated tomographic reconstruction is now possible in the IMOD software package, including the merging of tomograms taken around two orthogonal axes. Several developments enable the production of high-quality tomograms. When using fiducial markers for alignment, the markers to be tracked through the series are chosen automatically; if there is an excess of markers available, a well-distributed subset is selected that is most likely to track well. Marker positions are refined by applying an edge-enhancing Sobel filter, which results in a 20% improvement in alignment error for plastic-embedded samples and 10% for frozen-hydrated samples. Robust fitting, in which outlying points are given less or no weight in computing the fitting error, is used to obtain an alignment solution, so that aberrant points from the automated tracking can have little effect on the alignment. When merging two dual-axis tomograms, the alignment between them is refined from correlations between local patches; a measure of structure was developed so that patches with insufficient structure to give accurate correlations can now be excluded automatically. We have also developed a script for running all steps in the reconstruction process with a flexible mechanism for setting parameters, and we have added a user interface for batch processing of tilt series to the Etomo program in IMOD. Batch processing is fully compatible with interactive processing and can increase efficiency even when the automation is not fully successful, because users can focus their effort on the steps that require manual intervention.},

   abstract = {Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) allows cellular ultrastructures and macromolecular complexes to be imaged in three-dimensions in their native environments. Cryo-electron tomograms are reconstructed from projection images taken at defined tilt-angles. In order to recover high-resolution information from cryo-electron tomograms, it is necessary to measure and correct for the contrast transfer function (CTF) of the microscope. Most commonly, this is performed using protocols that approximate the sample as a two-dimensional (2D) plane. This approximation accounts for differences in defocus and therefore CTF across the tilted sample. It does not account for differences in defocus of objects at different heights within the sample; instead, a 3D approach is required. Currently available approaches for 3D-CTF correction are computationally expensive and have not been widely implemented. Here we simulate the benefits of 3D-CTF correction for high-resolution subtomogram averaging, and present a user-friendly, computationally-efficient 3D-CTF correction tool, NovaCTF, that is compatible with standard tomogram reconstruction workflows in IMOD. We validate the approach on synthetic data and test it using subtomogram averaging of real data. Consistent with our simulations, we find that 3D-CTF correction allows high-resolution structures to be obtained with much smaller subtomogram averaging datasets than are required using 2D-CTF. We also show that using equivalent dataset sizes, 3D-CTF correction can be used to obtain higher-resolution structures. We present a 3.4Å resolution structure determined by subtomogram averaging.},

   abstract = {AreTomo, an abbreviation for Alignment and Reconstruction for Electron Tomography, is a GPU accelerated software package that fully automates motion-corrected marker-free tomographic alignment and reconstruction in a single package. By correcting in-plane rotation, translation, and importantly, the local motion resulting from beam-induced motion from tilt to tilt, AreTomo can produce tomograms with sufficient accuracy to be directly used for subtomogram averaging. Another major application is the on-the-fly reconstruction of tomograms in parallel with tilt series collection to provide users with real-time feedback of sample quality allowing users to make any necessary adjustments of collection parameters. Here, the multiple alignment algorithms implemented in AreTomo are described and the local motions measured on a typical tilt series are analyzed. The residual local motion after correction for global motion was found in the range of ± 80 Å, indicating that the accurate correction of local motion is critical for high-resolution cryo-electron tomography (cryoET).},

   abstract = {Sarcomeres, the basic contractile units of striated muscle, produce the forces driving muscular contraction through cross-bridge interactions between actin-containing thin filaments and myosin II-based thick filaments. Until now, direct visualization of the molecular architecture underlying sarcomere contractility has remained elusive. Here, we use in situ cryo-electron tomography to unveil sarcomere contraction in frozen-hydrated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. We show that the hexagonal lattice of the thick filaments is already established at the neonatal stage, with an excess of thin filaments outside the trigonal positions. Structural assessment of actin polarity by subtomogram averaging reveals that thin filaments in the fully activated state form overlapping arrays of opposite polarity in the center of the sarcomere. Our approach provides direct evidence for thin filament sliding during muscle contraction and may serve as a basis for structural understanding of thin filament activation and actomyosin interactions inside unperturbed cellular environments. Sarcomeres, the building blocks of striated muscles, comprise ordered actomyosin arrays involved in force production. Here, the authors visualize sarcomere organization in neonatal cardiomyocytes with in situ cryo-electron tomography, revealing a reduced order of the thin filaments, their sliding and functional states enabling contraction.},

@article{Erdmann2021,
   abstract = {Ribosomes comprise a large (LSU) and a small subunit (SSU) which are synthesized independently in the nucleolus before being exported into the cytoplasm, where they assemble into functional ribosomes. Individual maturation steps have been analyzed in detail using biochemical methods, light microscopy and conventional electron microscopy (EM). In recent years, single particle analysis (SPA) has yielded molecular resolution structures of several pre-ribosomal intermediates. It falls short, however, of revealing the spatiotemporal sequence of ribosome biogenesis in the cellular context. Here, we present our study on native nucleoli in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, in which we follow the formation of LSU and SSU precursors by in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA). By combining both positional and molecular data, we reveal gradients of ribosome maturation within the granular component (GC), offering a new perspective on how the liquid-liquid-phase separation of the nucleolus supports ribosome biogenesis. The large and small subunits of the ribosome are synthesized independently within the nucleolus — a membrane-less compartment within the nucleus — before being exported into the cytoplasm. Here, the authors use in situ cryo-ET to observe ribosome maturation and reveal the native organization of the nucleolus.},

@article{Dietrich2022,
   abstract = {Filamentous enzymes have been found in all domains of life, but the advantage of filamentation is often elusive1. Some anaerobic, autotrophic bacteria have an unusual filamentous enzyme for CO2 fixation—hydrogen-dependent CO2 reductase (HDCR)2,3—which directly converts H2 and CO2 into formic acid. HDCR reduces CO2 with a higher activity than any other known biological or chemical catalyst4,5, and it has therefore gained considerable interest in two areas of global relevance: hydrogen storage and combating climate change by capturing atmospheric CO2. However, the mechanistic basis of the high catalytic turnover rate of HDCR has remained unknown. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the structure of a short HDCR filament from the acetogenic bacterium Thermoanaerobacter kivui. The minimum repeating unit is a hexamer that consists of a formate dehydrogenase (FdhF) and two hydrogenases (HydA2) bound around a central core of hydrogenase Fe-S subunits,&nbsp;one HycB3 and two HycB4. These small bacterial polyferredoxin-like proteins oligomerize through their C-terminal helices to form the backbone of the filament. By combining structure-directed mutagenesis with enzymatic analysis, we show that filamentation and rapid electron transfer through the filament enhance the activity of HDCR. To investigate the structure of HDCR in situ, we imaged T. kivui cells with cryo-electron tomography and found that HDCR filaments bundle into large ring-shaped superstructures attached to the plasma membrane. This supramolecular organization may further enhance the stability and connectivity of HDCR to form a specialized metabolic subcompartment within the cell. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of the&nbsp;filamentous hydrogen-dependent CO2 reductase (HDCR) enzyme from Thermoanaerobacter kivui, together with enzymatic analysis and in situ&nbsp;cryo-electron tomography, provides insight into the high catalytic activity of HDCR.},
