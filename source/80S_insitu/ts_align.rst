Tilt-series Alignment
===============

Fiducial-less Alignment using AreTomo with TOMOMAN
-----------------

As this turorial dataset consists of the tilt-series acquired on cryo-FIB milled lamellae, we can't use fiducial based alignment as in the case of HIV practical.
However, multiple fiducial-less methods have been developed. Notably: 
- Patch tracking in IMOD
- fiducial-less alignment using ALIGNATOR
- fiducial-less alignment using AreTomo

For this practical, we will use TOMOMAN functionality for fiducial-less alignment using AreTomo.
I would strongly recommend to familiarize oneself with the AreTomo Manual. 

1. Open ``tomoman_aretomo.param`` file. 
The directory parameters should already be correct.

2.
