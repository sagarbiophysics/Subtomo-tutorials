Bin8 Subtomogram Averaging with STOPGAP
=============

.. highlight:: matlab


In this part, we will first prepare the necessary files and folders for a STOPGAP subtomogram averaging job. 
Then we will perform â€œreference-freeâ€ subtomogram averaging on a single HIV particle; this will serve as a de novo reference for the whole dataset. 

Preparing a STOPGAP folder
-----------------


Here we will initialize a subtomogram averaging folder with the necessary directory structure. 

1. In your ``HIV_practical`` directory, make ``subtomo/i/`` subdirectory. 
Change into the ``init_ref/`` directory. 
 
2. Load the STOPGAP module.
 
3. Run the initialize folder command with the subtomo task:

::
     
     $ stopgap_initialize_folder.sh subtomo
 
4. The folder now has the required structure for subtomogram averaging jobs. 
Re-running ``stopgap_intialize_folder.sh`` for other jobs will add the additional required folders without affecting old ones.
 
5. From the ``/scratch/subtomo_pratical/SLURM_scripts/`` folder, copy ``run_stopgap.sh``, ``stopgap_extract_parser.sh``, and ``stopgap_subtomo_parser.sh``. 

Preparing Lists
-----------------

For subtomogram averaging with STOPGAP, several types of lists are required. 
The first is a motivelist; we will parse out a single HIV particle from the one we have already made. 
The second is a wedgelist, which contains the necessary information for missing wedge compensation. 
The third is a STOPGAP tomolist, which links the paths and names of the tomograms to use with the ``tomo_num`` field in the tomolist and motivelist; this is used for subtomogram extraction. 

1. In MATLAB, load the motivelist we have already generated:

::
     
     motl = sg_motl_read2('allmotl_1.star');

.. note::
     There are two ``sg_motl_read`` functions; the difference is in how they load the data. While ``sg_motl_read()`` is formatted in a way that is a bit easier to read, it requires substantially more memory. 
 
2. We will parse our desired subtomograms using logical indexing. As an illustration,  we will first index by tomo_num; in this case we want tomo 1. (In this example, this will result in matching all particles, but not if there are multiple tomograms)

::
     
     idx1 = motl.tomo_num == 1;
 
3. Next we will index by object. We will pick object 1:

::
     
     idx2 = motl.object == 1;
 
4. We will parse the subtomograms into a new motivelist:

::
     
     new_motl = sg_motl_parse_type2(motl,(idx1&idx2));

.. note::
     we combined the two indices we made using MATLABâ€™s logical operators. 
 
5. Save the new motivelist:

::
     
     sg_motl_write2('allmotl_tomo1_obj1_1.star',new_motl);


..note::
     STOPGAP motivelists have the following format ``[name]_[iteration].star``, where iteration is the iteration of the subtomogram averaging run. 
     The name is arbitrary but should not contain non-letter characters except for underscores. 
 
6. Generate a wedgelist:

::
     
     sg_wedgelist_from_tomolist('tomolist.mat','wedgelist.star');
 
7. Generate a STOPGAP tomolist:

::
     
     sg_extract_make_tomolist('tomolist.mat',[pwd,'/novactf_bin8/'],'sg_tomolist.txt');
 
8. Copy the three lists into the lists/ subfolder in your STOPGAP directory. 

Extract Subtomograms
-----------------


With the lists we have prepared, we are now ready to extract our subtomograms. 
STOPGAP jobs typically work by first generating a parameter file for a given task, and submitting it to SLURM using the ``run_stopgap.sh`` script. 

1. Open the ``stopgap_extract_parser.sh`` in a text editor (e.g. gedit).
 
2. Update the ``rootdir`` to the working directory. 
The other directory parameters can be left alone; they are overrides to the standard STOPGAP structure. 
 
3. Update the file options. 
Since these are all lists, they are assumed to be in the ``listdir``. 

.. note::
     since we are providing a ``tomolist``, the ``tomodir`` is ignored. 
 
4. Set the extraction parameters. 
The default ``subtomo_name`` is ``â€˜subtomoâ€™``. 
For ``boxsize``, ``32`` should be sufficient here.
The ``pixelsize`` is ``10.8`` for bin8 data. 
For ``output_format``, we find that ``â€˜mrc8â€™`` works well, this saves the subtomogram as an 8-bit ``.mrc`` file.
While 8-bit only provides 256 gradations, we generally find this is sufficient for the local information contained within a subtomogram. 
During extraction, the subtomogram is cropped and its values are floated between 0 and 255, rounded, and saved. 
 
5. Save the file. Run in the terminal; this will generate a new parameter file in the ``params/`` folder. 
 
6. Open ``run_stopgap.sh`` in a text editor. 
The main parameters here are the parallelization options and the directories. 
Update the ``rootdir`` and ``paramfilename``.
 
7. For parallelization parameters, set ``run_type`` to ``â€˜slurmâ€™``, ``nodes`` to ``1``, and ``n_cores`` to ``96`` divided by the number of participants. 
STOPGAP is a CPU-only package, so set ``queue`` to ``â€˜centosâ€™``, which are the CPU nodes. 
The ``/scratch`` space is relatively fast and there is no local storage on the nodes, so set ``copy_local`` to ``0``. 
 
8. Run STOPGAP by running the ``run_stopgap.sh`` script. 
STOPGAP is setup here to run through the ``stopgap_watcher``, which is a separate program to track STOPGAP progress. 
This is not required; for clusters where programs are not allowed to be run on submission nodes, ``stopgap_watcher`` can be run on any computer that has access to the working directory. 
 

Calculate Starting Reference
-----------------


â€œReference-freeâ€ basically refers to the fact that we are not using an external reference. 
Since a reference is always required for iterative alignment, we can generate an starting reference by averaging the extracted subtomograms. 
In this case, since we have picked our positions using geometry, we have rough starting angles; our initial reference will not be a sphere, but instead of rough features. 

1. Subtomogram averaging in STOPGAP always involves calculating a Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) in order to output two halfmaps and a figure-of-merit weighted average. 
Our motivelist doesnâ€™t currently have A/B halfsets defined, so halfmaps are randomly generated. 
For FSC calculation, a alignment mask (mask) is always required. 
Since we donâ€™t know the reference structure, we can simply provide a basic sphere with a Gaussian dropoff (always include a soft edge on your alignment masks). 
In MATLAB, make a sphere mask and save into the ``mask/`` folder. From your subtomogram averaging directory:

::
     
     sphere = sg_sphere(32,10,3);
     sg_mrcwrite('masks/sphere.mrc',sphere);

Check the mask using 3dmod. What you want is a soft-edged mask that drops to 0 before hitting the box edges. 
 
2. Open ``stopgap_subtomo_parser.sh`` in a text editor. 
Update the ``rootdir`` and main file options; ``ccmask_name`` is ignored for averaging jobs. 
 
3. The main settings for this job are in the Job parameters block. 
Since we are just averaging a single reference, set ``subtomo_mode`` to ``â€˜avg_singlerefâ€™``. 
Because we are on iteration 1, set ``startidx`` to ``1``. 
For averaging jobs, ``iterations`` is ignored. Set ``binning`` to ``8``. 
 
4. Run the subtomo parser. 
Update ``paramfilename`` in ``run_stopgap.sh``. 
 
5. Run STOPGAP to generate average. 
 
6. Open the three ``.mrc`` files in the ``ref/`` folder in 3dmod. 
STOPGAP alignment and averaging runs always output 3 references, named ``[ref_name]_[iteration].mrc``, ``[ref_name]_A_[iteration].mrc``, and ``[ref_name]_B_[iteration].mrc``. 
A and B are raw halfsets; these are often noisy as they are not figure-of-merit weighted. 
The reference without a halfset designation is a figure-of-merit weighted average of A and B; this is NOT a fully processed reference and is supplied as a quick check of your job. 
For structural interpretation, the halfsets should be figure-of-merit weighted, low pass filtered to the estimated resolution, and B-factor sharpened; this can be done in MATLAB using the sg_calculate_FSC function. 

Perform Z-alignment
-----------------

Since the HIV particles are not true spheres, our initial positions are quite rough. 
This is particularly true for the radial position (Z-axis in this dataset). 
In this step, we will perform a quick alignment with no angular search; this will improve the radial density in our reference, which will allow us to generate a tighter reference mask. 

1. In MATLAB make a cross-correlation mask (ccmask). 
These are used to restrict the particle shifts during alignment. 
For this dataset, there is potentially a large error in the Z-direction, but error in the XY-plane is well defined. 
Since we seeded our positions at half the inter-subunit spacing, this is the maximum error. 
The appropriate shape for this type of error is a cylinder:

::
     
     ccmask = sg_cylinder(32,4,24);
     sg_mrcwrite('masks/ccmask.mrc',ccmask);


.. note::
     A ccmask should always be binary!
 
2. Open the subtomo parser. Update the ``subtomo_mode`` to ``â€˜ali_singlerefâ€™``.
 
3. Set the angular search parameters.
STOPGAP has multiple search strategies, with overlapping parameter sets. 
For now, set ``search_mode`` to ``â€˜hcâ€™``, ``search_type`` to ``â€˜coneâ€™``, and ``cone_search_type`` to ``â€˜coarseâ€™``. 
Since we donâ€™t want to do any angular search for this iteration, set ``angincr``, ``angiter``, ``phi_angincr``, and ``phi_angiter`` to ``0``. 
 
4. Set the bandpass filter settings. 
In general, the high pass filter defaults (``hp_rad=1``, ``hp_sigma=2``) is fine; this mainly suppresses any normalization issues with the central voxel in Fourier space. 
More important is to keep track of the low-pass filter radius (lp_rad) during your run; a lp_sigma of 3 is usually fine. A rule of thumb is to make sure the lp_rad is less-than or equal to the Fourier radius where FSC=0.5. 
Since we donâ€™t really have any resolution in our map, we can arbitrarily set it to 60 Ã… for now. STOPGAP sets filter values in Fourier pixels, a real-space values do not round well, particularly for small boxsizes or high binnings. 
You can covert resolution to Fourier pixels as:

.. math::
     
     fpix =  \frac{((boxsize * pixelsize))}{resolution}

so for our settings, 60 Ã… is 5.76 Fourier pixels. 
Since we cannot set fractional pixels, we can round to 6, which is a resolution of 57.6 Ã….
 
5. Run the parser and run STOPGAP. 
 
6. Check ``ref_2.mrc`` in 3dmod. 
After this alignment, we now have the 3 layers we saw in the tomograms. 
In 3dmod, you can also look at isosurface maps using ``shift+u``. 
Despite no angular alignment, we already have some resolution of the in-plane structure. 

Rough Angular Alignment
-----------------

Now that we have a reference with some level of structure, we can do several things. 
First we will make a new alignment mask to focus on our structure. 
Since we have not done any angular search, we will start with a rough angular alignment using large angular steps. 

1. Start chimera and open ref_2.mrc. 
Maps written by STOPGAP are not contrast-inverted, so you will need to uncheck the â€œCap high values at box facesâ€ option in Volume Viewer > Features > Surface and Mesh Options. Set the voxel size to 1.
 
2. Open the sphere mask. 
To view the mask on top of the structure, it can be helpful to adjust the opacity of the mask. 
The position of your average in Z depends on a few factors such as your initial particle centering and radius, and as such, it will be different for everyone. 
However, it is likely that the sphere mask does not adequately mask in your average. 
 
3. The shape of this structure is reasonably well-suited for a cylindrical mask. 
You want the binary parts of the mask to contain the entire structure with the soft edge starting outside of it. 
Since the structure continues beyond the box boundaries in the XY-plane, this would just be as large as possible while making sure the mask ends before touching the box boundaries. 
An example that worked for me is:

::
     
     cyl_mask = sg_cylinder(32,10,20,3,[17,17,14]);
     sg_mrcwrite('cyl_mask.mrc',cyl_mask);


.. note::
     since your structure is probably a bit offset, you will need to define the center when using the ``sg_cylinder`` function. I measured this using 3dmod. 
 
4. Generate alignment parameters using ``stopgap_subtomo_parser.sh``. 
You will need to increment your ``startidx`` and update your ``mask_name``. 
We will use a coarse cone search with hill climbing, so the final parameters to decide on are the angular increments. 
The ``angincr`` and ``angiter`` parameters control the off-plane (i.e. off the XY-plane) search. 
If you want to be very precise, you could calculate half the angular offset between two particles from your inter-particle distance and radius; for me this is ~2deg, so ``angincr=2`` and ``angiter=3`` should be plenty. 
For ``phi_angincr`` and ``phi_angiter``, which are control the in-plane search, we can use our knowledge that there is C6 symmetry, so the maximum error is +/- 30 deg. 
For an initial coarse search, we can then set ``phi_angincr=12`` and ``phi_angiter=3`` to find the nearest symmetry element (with a bit extra).  
 
5. Parse parameters and run alignment. 
 
7. The reference should look pretty structured now. 
Keep in mind, for iterative averaging, the quality of your alignment depends on the reference from the last around. 
As such, it is often useful to run 2 iterations per parameter set but rarely useful to run more than 2. 
Parse another iteration (remember to increment ``startidx``) with the same parameters and run alignment again. 
 
8. At this point, the reference should be relatively well resolved, looking like a grid of filled and empty spaces. 
The symmetry axis we want to use is in one of the empty space, so we may need to shift the reference in the XY plane. 
To do so, determine the offset in 3dmod and open the ``sg_motl_shift_and_rotate.m`` script in MATLAB; this generates a new motivelist with shifted positions. 
I will typically append the new motivelist name with something descriptive like â€œ_shiftâ€. Update the motivelist and reference names in the parser and generate an averaging run. Generate a new average.
 
9. Compare the old and new references to make sure it was shifted properly. 
If it wasnâ€™t you may have applied the shifts with the wrong sign. 
If so, re-apply shifts and re-average. 
 
10. Now that the reference is properly centered along the symmetry axis, we can apply a C6 symmetry (symmetry=â€™C6â€™). 
With the shift, there may be a bit of off-plane error introduced, so increase the angular iterations to 4. 
Parse parameters and perform another round of alignment. 
 
11. The reference should look much better now. 
Keep in mind, the output references from STOPGAP do NOT have symmetry applied. 
From here, we can refine the average a bit by reducing the angular search. 
Since the in-plane search already used a small angle, we can leave the increment alone and reduce the iterations to 2. 
For phi, we are arguably accurate within 12 degrees; reducing the phi increment to 4 with 4 iterations should be safe. 
Update the parameters and run 2 iterations. 
 
12. At this point the reference is largely converged. 
If you check the FSC plot generated by STOPGAP, the structure should be well beyond Nyquist.

Clearing Overlapping Particles
-----------------

Now that the structure has converged, we can take a look at how the particles have aligned by visualizing them as a lattice map. 
For this we will use the Place Objects Chimera plugin. 

1. Covert the motivelist to AV3 .em format in MATLAB using ``sg_motl_stopgap_2_av3``.
 
2. Start Chimera and open the tomogram. 
Remember to set ``Origin index`` to ``0`` and ``Voxel size`` to ``1``. 
Load motivelist using ``Place Object`` plugin and visualize using ``Hexagons``, ``voxel-size 0.2``, and ``colour style`` as ``Cross-Correlation``. 
 
3. You may notice that the hexagon edges do not line up; this is because the rotation in your average is unlikely to be the same as Place Objectâ€™s particles. 
You can adjust the Phi-Offset parameter to fix this. 
 
4. You should see that most of the oversampled positions have converged and overlapped; these are a good sign of true subunit positions. 
In general, cross correlation (CC) scores are lower at the tops and bottoms, owing to the missing wedge. 
There will also be defects in the lattice with lower CC values, this is expected as it is impossible to close a surface using just hexagons. 

5. Some particles with low CC values will be completely misaligned; this can be due getting trapped in local minima or particles that are in regions where there is no lattice. 
We can determine what an appropriate CC value cutoff is by setting Visualization to Cross-Correlation and adjusting the Lower CC Threshold slider. 

.. note::
     this is relative value that is affected by many factors such as binning and defocus of the tomogram, so you cannot reuse the same value. Determine an appropriate cutoff and write it down. 
 
6. In MATLAB, open ``sg_motl_distance_clean.m``. 
Set ``s_cut`` to the cutoff you determined in the previous step. For ``d_cut``, choose a value that is smaller than the true interparticle distance. 
Run the script to clean your motivelist. 
 
7. After cleaning, convert to AV3 format and check in Chimera. 

.. note::
     most of your particles may now look red; this is because the color scaling is relative to the lowest and highest CC values. 
 
8. If you are satisfied with the cleaning, generate a new average with the cleaned motivelist.
 
9. If you check your FSC plots pre- and post-cleaning, you may find it has worsened. 
Remember, FSC is NOT an objective resolution measure but instead a self-consistency measure. 
Your FSC was likely over-inflated due to identical particles in both halfsets. 
At this point, we can consider this final average the initial de novo reference. 

Aligning the Full Dataset
-----------------

Here we will go over how to take your initial reference and align it against the full dataset. 

1. Make a new subtomogram averaging folder ``subtomo/full/`` and initialize it for subtomogram averaging. 
Copy your previous wedgelist, tomolist, and masks, into the new folder. 
Copy a set of STOPGAP bash scripts. 
 
2. Copy your final initial reference into the ``ref/`` folder, but rename as ``ref_1.mrc`` and etcâ€¦ 
Technically, the weighted reference is not required, only the halfsets. 
 
3. Copy the full motivelist.
 
4. Extract subtomograms. 
 
5. Align the full dataset. 
This problem is distinct from the de novo structure determine we performed for the initial dataset. 
This is because in de novo structure determination, we slow coax the structure out by iterative refinement and reducing our angular search space. 
Here, we already have a good reference, so if our parameters are too coarse, we may generate a worse reference than the one we put in. 
As such, our goal is to align the full dataset to the same precision that we aligned the initial reference; i.e. our angular increments should be the same. 
Therefore, the main parameter to change here is the angular iterations so that we sample wide enough. 
Set your parameters and run 1 iteration of alignment. 
 
6. After alignment, the reference should look less noisy, though the resolution is still limited by the binning. 
The full motivelist is likely requires to much memory for the BAND sessions, so we can first distance clean the overlapping particles. 
In this case, donâ€™t apply a score cutoff, as we havenâ€™t determined what it should be yet. 
 
7. Convert the cleaned motivelist to AV3 format and open in Chimera. 
Determine an appropriate CC cutoff and parse the good particles by logical indexing. E.g.:

::

     motl = sg_motl_read2('allmotl_dclean_2.star');
     idx = motl.score >= 0.4;
     new_motl = sg_motl_parse_type2(motl,idx);
     sg_motl_write2('allmotl_dclean_sclean_2.star',new_motl);
 
8. Generate a new average with the cleaned motivelist. 
Since we are already well beyond Nyquist, itâ€™s unnecessary to perform any more angular refinement. 
We can go on to rescaling the motivelist to bin4.
